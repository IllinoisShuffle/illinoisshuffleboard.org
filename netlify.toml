# ========================================
# Notes for Maintainers
# ========================================
#
# When updating redirects:
# 1. Update the destination URL
# 2. Update the comment with the current year/season
# 3. Test the redirect after deploying
# 4. Consider using 301 for permanent redirects
#
# To add a new redirect:
# 1. Choose a short, memorable path (e.g., /myevent)
# 2. Add a [[redirects]] block with from, to, and status
# 3. Add a comment explaining what it links to
# 4. Commit and push - Netlify will apply on next deploy
#
# Common patterns:
# - Event links: /eventname
# - Tracking links: /l/source-name
# - Forms: descriptive names like /volunteer
# - Documents: match the document name (e.g., /rules)
#
# Avoid:
# - Special characters in URLs
# - Very long paths
# - Paths that conflict with site pages
