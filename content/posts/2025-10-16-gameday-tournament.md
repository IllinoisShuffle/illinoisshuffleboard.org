Join us for a school-spirit focused team tournament on November 2nd at Royal Palms. This tournament is open to 64 players, who will sign up as individuals. After registering, you’ll be asked to submit a form detailing your school affiliations - Do you cheer for the college in the town where you grew up? Where you went to school? Where your friends all went but they have a better football program so you cheer for them? You’ll then be placed on a team based on these rooting interests!

You’ll represent your school on the courts as you work together with your team to bring your school glory. In addition to crowning a champion we’ll also have prizes for school spirit so get ready to bust out your team swag, practice your fight song, and show off your school pride.
