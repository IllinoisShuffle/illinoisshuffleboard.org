This past fall, a commission was created to review the ILSA points system.
That group gathered member feedback and then developed a proposal that represented the expressed values of the community.
We are excited to announce their proposal was adopted at the December board meeting and is in effect as of 1/1/25.

**In the new system, the maximum number of points possible from any given event is adjusted based on the number of competitors, the format, and type of event.**
Additionally, competitors will now earn points for participating to incentivize participation.
Take a look at the [Quick Reference Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lYMMS3qpvkfcv2OULeBywNyoEAnzjssb/view) to learn about the new policy.
The full document on how points are awarded can be found in our [State Points Document](https://www.illinoisshuffleboard.org/documents/ILSA%20State%20Points%202.0.pdf), and a reader’s digest version is the works!

Many thanks to commission members Rob O’Mahoney, Samantha Gallagher, Kristen Haut, Kevin Reedy, and Tyler Berry for all their work on this project!
