The Illinois Shuffleboard Association's singles league is back for the Spring, and [we are now offering two divisions](https://app.recrec.io/seasons/3KBCQY/info)!

If competition is your main focus, the new match and league format in the [Challenge Division](https://app.recrec.io/divisions/2gPsZZ/info) will test your skills and strategy all season long.

The [FUNdamental Division](https://app.recrec.io/divisions/BKJs3J/info) is a continuation of our previous match and league formats, and provides an opportunity to focus on your fundamental skills while having fun along the way.

Both are a great way to improve your shuffleboard game while meeting more members of our incredible community.
