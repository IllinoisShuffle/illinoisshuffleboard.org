Registration is open for our Winter 2025 Singles League!
We're continuing to have two divisions:

FUNdamental - a low-stress way to meet other shufflers and work on your skills together!

Challenge - every match will be against someone of a similar skill set, battling to make it to playoffs. Every game is a challenge!

Registration closes Sunday January 6th at 5pm CT. More details and registration can be found at [https://app.recrec.io/seasons/3emCxR/info](https://app.recrec.io/seasons/3emCxR/info). If you have any questions, shoot an email to our Singles League Commission at league@illinoisshuffleboard.org. They'll also be hosting a league orientation at 7pm on January 29th on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/83772519677?pwd=0EF3Em9YovPqM6NqMV7GBbtCOFNrul.1) to answer any additional questions about the league, or our new points structure that is in place for 2025!
